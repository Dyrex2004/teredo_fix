# Windows 10 TeredoFix script
## To get your game on again
NOTE: This script can only fix problems related to your local Teredo config!
Also check your router settings if it is still not working afterwards.

Remember to run the script as admin, otherwise it won't work.



PS: I don't care wether the code looks awful to you. If it works, it works.
